🔋 Project Overview
This project develops an AI/ML-powered Battery Management System (BMS) for Electric Vehicles (EVs) to ensure optimized battery performance, extended battery life, and enhanced safety. By leveraging machine learning algorithms and data analytics, the system predicts battery health, manages charging/discharging cycles efficiently, and prevents hazardous conditions like overcharging and overheating.

🚗 Key Features
🔍 Battery Health Prediction: Machine Learning models predict the State of Health (SoH) and State of Charge (SoC) in real-time.

⚡ Smart Charging/Discharging Control: Optimizes charge-discharge cycles based on usage patterns and environmental conditions.

🌡️ Thermal Management: Predictive analytics to avoid thermal runaway by monitoring temperature fluctuations.

📊 Anomaly Detection: Detects anomalies (voltage drops, temperature spikes) for proactive maintenance.

🌍 Energy Optimization: Improves energy efficiency, thereby extending driving range.

🧠 Self-learning Algorithms: Continuously improves performance based on new battery usage data.
